# Comprehensive Image Processing with MATLAB

This MATLAB project includes a comprehensive user interface for processing images using advanced digital image processing techniques. The tasks performed in this project include:

- Converting images to grayscale
- Threshold-based conversion to black and white
- Histogram equalization
- Image quantization
- Gaussian blurring
- Applying Laplace masks for sharpening
- Edge detection
- Morphological operations like erosion, dilation, and skeletonization

The user interface allows users to easily perform these tasks on given images. This project showcases the use of MATLAB for advanced image processing applications.

## Usage

To use the user interface, simply run the MATLAB script and follow the instructions on the interface to perform various image processing tasks.

Feel free to customize this README.md file to include any additional information or instructions specific to your project.
